# About

**Iconic** is a **Fabric client-side Mod** which allows modpack developers and resource pack creators to change a bunch of hard-coded features.

!!! warning
    **Iconic** is currently in a very early state, and is prone to breaking changes. It's more of a proof-of-concept than something you should use right now.

# To-Do

- [ ] Allow item models to have both inventory and in-world models (like Tridents and Spyglasses).
- [ ] Allow every tooltip in the game to be easily customizable using resource packs.
- [ ] Allow resource packs to add custom tooltips to item(stacks).



## Possible Features

- Using icons in text fields like chat or signs.
- Support multiple versions, at least from 1.16 up to the latest version.
- Possibly make it compatible with Forge.
